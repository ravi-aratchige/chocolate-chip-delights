# Chocolate Chip Delights

This is a demo website built to show a basic cookie consent popup appearing in the form of a bar at the bottom of the site, placed above a translucent overlay.
<br>
This has been build purely with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries have been used.
<br>
<br>
## How It Works
<br>
The cookie consent bar appears over the website when it is refreshed. It appears above a translucent overlay which prevents the user from interacting with the website until they have interacted with the cookie consent bar.
<br>
The bar has two buttons; "Sure, I'll have one!" for accepting cookies and "No thanks, I'm good." for declining cookies. Interacting with either button will remove the bar and overlay from the website.
<br>
<br>
## TO-DO
<br>
- [ ] Add a cookie/cookies to the user's browser to remember their decision
- [ ] Fix mobile responsivity
- [ ] Add a "Learn More" capability to the bar
